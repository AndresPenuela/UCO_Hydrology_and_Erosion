Whereas R-squared is a relative measure of fit, RMSE is an absolute measure of fit. As the square root of a variance, RMSE can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the unexplained variance. It has the useful property of being in the same units as the response variable. Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. RMSE is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the response. \n",

    "A hydrological model usually has a large number of parameters. The user is the one who decides the value of these parameters for a particular application based on the information and data we have about the parameters. Normally we will not have direct measurements of the values of these parameters, but it is likely that we will have historical climatic data and river flow (historical hydrograph of the river). With these data we can infer the values of the parameters by finding the values that make the model result better fit the historical hydrograph of the river, this is called **calibration** of the model.\n",
