    "# Catchment hydrological model with 5 parameters\n",
    "In this Notebook we are going to use a hydrological model, run it and calibrate it to try to understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we want to predict the hydrograph of a river that collects water from a basin when it rains. For this purpose we use a hydrological model, which is nothing more than a set of equations that describe in a simplified way the hydrological processes that occur in the basin. These equations include different parameters that describe some of the properties of the basin, for example the characteristics of the soil.\n",

    "In this example, we are going to use a simple model (an adaptation of the model [HyMOD](https://doi.org/10.1029/WS006)) which has 5 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soil storage capacity** (mm): capacity of the soil to retain rainwater\n",
    "- **Evaporation ratio**: evaporation ratio or proportion of rain that evaporates\n",
    "- **Percolation ratio**: percolation ratio proportion of effective rainwater (that does not evaporate) that percolates into the ground.\n",
    "- **Travel time - surface flow** (days): surface water concentration time or time it takes for surface water to reach the mouth of the basin.\n",
    "- **Travel time - underground flow** (days): groundwater concentration time or time it takes for groundwater to reach the mouth of the basin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below we can see how the model represents the hydrological processes in order to finally obtain the prediction of the river's hydrograph for the coming months. As you can see, the soil is presented as a deposit with a certain capacity that, if exceeded, overflows, generating surface flow and that also displaces water through its lower part, generating groundwater.\n",

    "### Calibration of the hydrological model\n",
    "A hydrological model usually has a large number of parameters. The user is the one who decides the value of these parameters for a particular application based on the information and data we have about the parameters. Normally we will not have direct measurements of the values of these parameters, but it is likely that we will have historical climatic data and river flow (historical hydrograph of the river). With these data we can infer the values of the parameters by finding the values that make the model result better fit the historical hydrograph of the river, this is called **calibration** of the model.\n",

Whereas R-squared is a relative measure of fit, RMSE is an absolute measure of fit. As the square root of a variance, RMSE can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the unexplained variance. It has the useful property of being in the same units as the response variable. Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. RMSE is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the response. \n",
