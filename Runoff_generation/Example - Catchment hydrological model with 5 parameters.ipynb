    "# Catchment hydrological model with 5 parameters\n",
    "In this Notebook we are going to use a hydrological model, run it and calibrate it to try to understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we want to predict the hydrograph of a river that collects water from a basin when it rains. For this purpose we use a hydrological model, which is nothing more than a set of equations that describe in a simplified way the hydrological processes that occur in the basin. These equations include different parameters that describe some of the properties of the basin, for example the characteristics of the soil.\n",
    "![diagrama cuenca](images/diagrama_cuenca.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are going to use a simple model (an adaptation of the model [HyMOD](https://doi.org/10.1029/WS006)) which has 5 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soil storage capacity** (mm): capacity of the soil to retain rainwater\n",
    "- **Evaporation ratio**: evaporation ratio or proportion of rain that evaporates\n",
    "- **Percolation ratio**: proportion of effective rainwater (that does not evaporate) that percolates into the ground.\n",
    "- **Travel time - surface flow** (days): surface water concentration time or time it takes for surface water to reach the mouth of the basin.\n",
    "- **Travel time - underground flow** (days): groundwater concentration time or time it takes for groundwater to reach the mouth of the basin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below we can see how the model represents the hydrological processes in order to finally obtain the prediction of the river's hydrograph for the coming months. As you can see, the soil is presented as a deposit with a certain capacity that, if exceeded, overflows, generating surface flow and that also displaces water through its lower part, generating groundwater.\n",
