    "# Water retention curve - van Genuchten model\n",
    "\n",
    "Water retention curve is the relationship between the water content, $Œ∏$ (or effective Sauration $S_e$), and the soil water potential, $œà_m$. This curve is characteristic for different types of soil, and is also called the soil moisture characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to predict the soil water storage, water supply to the plants or available water (field capacity - wilting point). \n",
    "\n",
    "The water retention curve can partially obtained in the lab: basically this is done by applying a given suction to a saturated soil sample and then we measure the volume of water that the soil loses. In this way we estimate the content water content for a given suction pressure. However, in this way we only obtain a limited number of measurements or points of the curve. To obtain the whole curve we need a model that best fit the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The water retention curve can be obtained by several models, one of them known as the Van Genuchten model:\n",

    "S_{e} = \\left[\\frac{1}{1 + (-\\alpha\\psi_{m})^n}\\right]^m\\\n",

    "where $\\alpha$ is a parameter of scale and $m$ and $n$ are parameters of shape. In general, $m = 1 - 1/n$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab using a pressure chamber we have measured the effective saturation $S_e$ of a soil sample for the following suction pressures ($œà_m$): -20, -60, -300, -800, -5000, -10000 cm and we have obtained the following values for $S_e$: 0.951, 0.914, 0.432, 0.172, 0.042, 0.023\n",
