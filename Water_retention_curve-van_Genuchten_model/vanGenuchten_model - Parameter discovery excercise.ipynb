    "# Water retention curve - van Genuchten model\n",
    "\n",
    "Water retention curve is the relationship between the water content, $Œ∏$ (or effective Sauration $S_e$), and the soil water potential, $œà_m$. This curve is characteristic for different types of soil, and is also called the soil moisture characteristic.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/water_retention_curve.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to predict the soil water storage, water supply to the plants or available water (field capacity - wilting point). \n",
    "\n",
    "The water retention curve is represented by the Van Genuchten model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{e} = \\left[\\frac{1}{1 + (-\\alpha\\psi_{m})^n}\\right]^m\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a parameter of scale and $m$ and $n$ are parameters of shape. In general, $m = 1 - 1/n$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to use an alternative way of writing the equation by using the definition of $S_e$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{e} = \\frac{\\theta - \\theta_r}{\\theta_s - \\theta_r}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so our original equation now becomes:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\theta = \\theta_r + (\\theta_s - \\theta_r) \\left[\\frac{1}{1 + (-\\alpha\\psi_{m})^n}\\right]^m\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_r$ is the residual water content (water attached tightly to soil particles and that the plant cannot use) and $\\theta_s$ is the saturation water content (when all the soil pores are full of water).\n",
