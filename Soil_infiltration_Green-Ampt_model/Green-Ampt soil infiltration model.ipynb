    "The Green-Ampt method represents the water infiltrating the soil during a rainfall event (or irrigation) as a sharp wetting front dividing saturated soil above from initial unsaturated (not necessarily dry) conditions below. This model makes several assumptions or simplifications of reality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It assumes that the soil surface is ponded from the beginning with a shallow sheet of water\n",
    "- The soil is deep and homogeneous, with a constant initial soil moisture in depth\n",
    "- The moisture advance front or wetting front is flat and it is a sharp discontinuity that raises moisture from and initial value to saturation as it descends in the soil profile during the rainfall event.\n",

    "- $h_0$ = depth of ponded water\n",
    "- $Œ∏$ = soil moisture or soil water content\n",

    "- $Œ∏_i$ = initial soil moisture content (before rainfall and infiltration start)\n",
    "- $Œ∏_r$ = residual soil moisture (for very dry soil conditions)\n",

Let's imagine that we would like to simulate the infiltration process of a **24-hour rainfall**, with an intensity of **40mm/h**. For this purpose, we use the Green-Ampt model and typical parameter values for 5 different soil textures: **loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, clay loam, and clay**. To explore and compare the results for different soil textures, just select one from the drop down menu that you will see after running the code below."
