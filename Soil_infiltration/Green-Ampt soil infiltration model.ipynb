    "The Green-Ampt method represents the water infiltrating the soil during a rainfall event (or irrigation) as a sharp wetting front dividing saturated soil above from initial unsaturated (not necessarily dry) conditions below. This model makes several assumptions or simplifications of reality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It assumes that the soil surface is ponded from the beginning with a shallow sheet of water\n",
    "- The soil is deep and homogeneous, with a constant initial soil moisture in depth\n",
    "- The moisture advance front or wetting front is flat and it is a sharp discontinuity that raises moisture from and initial value to saturation as it descends in the soil profile during the rainfall event.\n",

Let's imagine that we would like to simulate the infiltration process of a **24-hour rainfall**, with an intensity of **40mm/h**. For this purpose, we use the Green-Ampt model and typical parameter values for 5 different soil textures: **loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, clay loam, and clay**. To explore and compare the results for different soil textures, just select one from the drop down menu that you will see after running the code below."
